#+Title: Lick the Toad
#+SUBTITLE: A web based interface for displaced agencies in musical interaction.
#+Author: Konstantinos Vasilakos

* Introduction
** Back to the parlour
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Imagine a weekend afternoon in a middle class parlour during the second half of the nineteenth century: a soiree, with music performed live by family members gathered around the piano. This scene - once a common occurrence that fostered creative social interaction - became increasingly rare; being displaced by substitute social behaviours arising from technological developments such as sound recording (van der Merwe, 1989), television, etc. Furthermore, as the schism between ‘popular’ and ‘art’ deepened, and the latter demanded increasing levels of virtuosity in order to realise musical ideas, performance of certain strands of contemporary music became nearly impossible for anyone but professionals; disappearing from the ‘soiree’ repertoire.[[cite:&Fischman_Back_to_the_parlour_2011]]

** Bridging the audience agency in musical interaction
Ltt is a web interface designed for bridging the gap between performer(s) and audience, allowing former and latter to engage interactively. [[cite:&vasilakos_networked_2022-1]] [[cite:&vasilakos_lick_2021-1]] [[cite:&vasilakos_konstantinos_2021-4]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
To understand networked music system first a paraller maybe drawn with other examples of primitive distributed systems in music making. In 1895 Thaddeus Cahill submitted his first patent for the Telharmonium, influenced by other similar creations of the time in Europe and beyond [[cite:&manning_electronic_2004]]. What was common ground for these all was the idea of using modern available tellecommunications, to distribute live music electrically and most important, remotely, displaced from the actual site of the music performance. Therefore, modern technology apparatus and implicit networking was always in the forefront of pioneering music.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
A client allows to train a model in a web browser and trigger predictions based on a regression algorithm. Once the training process is done the system offers a visualization of the output values. The pitch of the patterns is based on a Markov chain module which is  generating predictions based on the neural network regression output values. At the same time, the client is able to send this data to another clients "listening" for incoming OSC messages (e.g., SuperCollider).

* Ltt's creative directions

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :align center
[[./img/sonified_image.jpg]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Ltt has been used as a standalone app for collective sonifications of bystanders and remote participants but since then it has taken many spins including a real-time chat engine amongst peers. That gives a large amount of freedom, as the use of raw data is an unbiased way and agnostic regarding the sound genration, that means, it can be mapped to an unlimited interpretations of sound events using arbitrary synthesis techniques.

** Live Coding: what now?

In live coding performances [[cite:&blackwell_live_2022]], there is always the question of how a coder is taking their decisions while changing the code on the fly, described also as "kairotic coding". [[cite:&cocker_what_2018]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Live coding is a performance paradigm using dynamic programming to build software in real time as a means to improvise with running algorithms, this somehow has been introducing obscurity  as it uses the act of programming, which may be seen as an esoteric form of expression for the wide audiences, however, this obscurity is not anew in other forms of pioneering electronic music  making especially with digital studio techniques that largely remaining behind the veil for the audience. That is to say, not only in the practical level, but also in the philosophical, for example, the act of deliberately detaching the sound from its source as a a form of compositional expression and thus, enabling the act of reduced listening in Acousmatic Music, which still remains the basic concept behind this genre. One way to tackle this issue that ltt took into consideration is the idea of sharing audiences data with the performer while improvising, and thus assigning to the audience a more dynamic role during improvisation.
#+END_NOTES

* Current & Ongoing Work
A study on live coding using ltt and standard and/or non-standard synthesis techniques, using Xenakis' fuzzy (probabilistic) methods.  [[cite:&fielder_sieves_2016]]  [[cite:&collins_stochastic_supercollider]] cite:ariza_sonifying_2009 [[cite:&luque_stochastic_2006]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[T]he amplitude and/or the time of the sound signal can be ruled by sieves. The subtle symmetries thus created should open a new field for exploration.  [[cite:&luque_stochastic_2006]]

** An overview of Stochastic Synthesis
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Term first used by Swiss 18th‐cent. mathematician Bernoulli regarding mathematical laws of probability. Applied by Xenakis to music procedures whereby overall sound contours are determined but inner details are left to chance or worked out mathematically by composer or by computer.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Dynamic Stochastic Synthesis (DSS) - (is often falsely confused with Xenakis' GENDYN algorithm [_Generation Dynamique_]). This technique is implemented by modulating sets of breakpoints of a waveform, that includes,  amplitude and durations based on stochastically varied values based on probabilistic distributions, e.g., uniform, Gaussian, Poisson) in real time [[cite:&luque_stochastic_2006]] known as random walks. This unique to computers non standard standard synthesis technique was musically deployed by Iannis Xenakis which he used to compose works such as Polytope de Cluny and Legende D 'Eer. Which not only paved the way for new compositional field but it created a new reference for noise music.

* Discussion
While ltt serves both as a standalone and live coding tool, it arguably allows for a greater coherence amongst peers on live performance. Similar to the concept of "back to the parlour" (Fischman, 2011) where members of the audience are able to enact an impromptu improvisation.

Thank you for listening...

#+BEGIN_NOTES
At the same time ltt remains agnostic on the sound output, when used for live performance, which allows for a great scale of exploration on various synthesis approaches depending on the idiomatic preferences of the  performer.
