Introduction
============


Lick the Toad
=============

  Ltt is a web interface designed for bridging the gap between
  performer(s) and audience, allowing former and latter to engage
  interactively.


Bridging the audience agency in musical interaction
===================================================

  It allows for real time of data interaction between clients and server
  offering an ideal tool to share data for musical interpretation on the
  fly.


Back to the parlour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        ... as the schism between ‘popular’ and ‘art’ deepened,
        and the latter demanded increasing levels of virtuosity in
        order to realise musical ideas, performance of certain
        strands of contemporary music became nearly impossible for
        anyone but professionals; disappearing from the ‘soiree’
        repertoire.

  /Fischman, R. (2011). Back to the parlour. Sonic Ideas – Ideas
  Sónicas, 3(2): 53–66./


Some implementation notes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1) Real time communication using web sockets[1]
  2) Sonifications on users' devices.
  3) OSC communication with: MaxMSP, SuperCollider, Pure Data, etc.

Ltt: machine Learning in the browser
====================================

Client Collection Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  A client allows to train a model in a web browser and triger
  predictions based on a regression algorithm. Once the training process
  is done the system offers visualization of the output values. The
  sound generation is based on a Markov chain module which is generating
  predictions based on the ml predictions. At the same time the client
  is able to send these data to other clients "listening" for incoming
  OSC messages.

Ltt's creative directions
=========================

  Ltt has been used as a standalone app for collective sonifications of
  bystanders and remote participants but since then it has taken many
  spins including a real time chat engine amongst peers.


Live Coding: what now?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  In live coding performances, there is always the question of how a
  coder is taking their decisions while changing the code on the fly,
  described also as "kairotic coding". /Cocker, E. (2018). What now,
  what next — kairotic coding and the unfolding future seized. Digital
  Creativity, 29(1), 82–95.

Ongoing Work
------------

  A study on live coding using ltt and stochastic processes[3] in
  SuperCollider's JITLib.

Discussion (instead of) Conclusion
==================================

  While ltt serves both as a standalone and live coding tool, it
  arguably allows for a greater coherence amongst peers on live
  performance. Similar to the concept of "back to the parlour" where
  members of the audience are able to enact an impromptu improvisation.
